During the last couple of years I've been closely following Elixir ecosystem while doing some side projects and one production project.

These include:
1. Telegram bot for storing and searching images and stickers and then giving them on demand in other chats.
2. Implementation of a paper game I played in school. I didn't find anything about it in the English internet but there's a Wikipedia page in Russian, German or Chinese.

 And my version of it:

 Frontend is written in Elm.
3. Implementation of alternative tic-tac-toe. I didn't implement frontend for it becuase I got lazy, but the backend is thorougly tested.

4. There's a fairly complex takehome task from another company I interviewed at about a year ago. It's reading world trading data and analyzing stocks in real time.

5. The production project was a payment logging system for bank transactions and swift wires. It involved reading transaction data from both users and businesses, storing, displaying and doing some analytics on them for our internal users (you can call it a kind of financial admin panel). Payment data was communicated to this system via RabbitMQ from our main end-user facing service.

I also did several simple "hello world" projects testing different tech like LiveView, GraphQL(absinthe), etc.
